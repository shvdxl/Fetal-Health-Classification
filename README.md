# Fetal-Health-Classification
With the increasing number of pregnancies now a day, lots of children and mothers die due 
to some illnesses and issues in pregnancy while the babies are still fetal. Many lives could 
have been saved if there had been an accurate diagnosis of the health condition for both 
maternal and fetal. Even though diagnostic tools for these purposes have improved, not 
everyone can afford them. Based on that, this project intends to build a machine-learning 
model meant for the classification of the fetus’ health state. By using an extracted feature 
from Cardiotocogram exams, the model will categorize the fetal health state as normal, 
suspect, or pathological. Additionally, the model will apply machine learning algorithms and 
techniques using Python programming language to achieve high accuracy. Having a healthy 
journey with pregnancy will be easy with this model which will predict the fetal health state 
and assist to decrease the number of fetal’ s and maternal’ s mortality, whether in developing 
or developed countries.
